# PhyLab2
This repository contains the code for Physics Lab 2 (PHY 2010) at the Ashoka University Sonipat. The code is for the following experiments: 
1. Visualising Equipotential Curves between two parallel conducting bars and two concentric circles
2. Verifying Newtons laws of motion using the Air Track apparatus
3. Observing the high pass and low pass filter configurations of Electronic Circuits (Analysis Performed in Excel/Google Sheets)
4. Electromagnetic Damping of a rotating metallic wheel
5. Observing free fall of a body that experiences air resistance and a body that experiences negligible air resistance
6. Using Kater's pendulum to find the local value of acceleration due to gravity 

Note: This is not official code from the University, this is my personal code written when I took the course there might be more efficient methods that can be used when analysing data, please be wary of errors
some of these code files might not contain the code for the entire experiment as the coding involved with each experiment was divided between my lab partner and I
